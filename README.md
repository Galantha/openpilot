My attempt to create a fork of openpilot for my Comma3 that is a bit more friendly for my use. Specifically:

Disables requirement to call home ever 7 days. Disables always on cameras recording. Reduces log space used on disk.

Various modifications to attempt to make the device last longer.

This a straight hack job.

suggest going to the real openpilot for real instructions: https://github.com/commaai/openpilot

I forked at version .

To install: https://smiskol.com/fork/Galantha/master This works on my comma 3, not tested on anything else.

Use at your own risk. Zero support offerred.

If you need to reset your comma 3, tapping the comma logo repeatedly on startup might work.
